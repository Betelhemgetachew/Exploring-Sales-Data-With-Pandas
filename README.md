# Exploring-Sales-Data-With-Pandas
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of 100 sales transactions using the Python library, pandas. The dataset includes product details such as product ID, name, quantity sold, unit price, customer ID, and country. Through data manipulation and analysis techniques, key insights on sales performance, product popularity, and customer behavior are derived.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: Import and inspect the dataset, including checking for missing values and duplicates.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types such as date columns.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate total sales for each product.
   - Identify the top 10 products with the highest total sales.
   - Analyze sales trends over time by grouping data by month.
   - Visualize sales per country using bar charts and sales trends over time using line graphs.
4. **Insightful Queries**: Answer key business questions such as identifying the best-selling product category, the month with the highest sales, and the top 10 customers by sales.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing sales data using charts.
